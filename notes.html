            <p><strong>Web developers use programming languages to build websites and web applications.</strong></p>
            <p>Your primary task as a web developer will be to create reliable and high-performing web-based applications and services. Focusing solely on the underlying software and databases (known as the 'back end') is most common. However, some web developers work on the interface and visual design (the 'front end'), and others combine both ('full-stack development').

                Whether you're in an agency or working as a freelancer, your job will be to create products that meet clients' needs. The work can be varied, and you may have several projects running simultaneously. You'll have regular meetings with clients to discuss their requirements and update them on progress.
                
                Job titles can vary according to the focus of the role.</p>
